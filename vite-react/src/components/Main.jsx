      <p>
        My dedication and perseverance toward the journey of coding has given me
        the strength to believe in myself. Currently, I am working on sharpening
        my developer skills by learning and applying the knowledge of popular
        frameworks like React which will help me build exicting and unique
        projects.

        Apart from coding, I enjoy cooking as well as spending time with my
        family. Also, I love travelling to different places to enjoy new
